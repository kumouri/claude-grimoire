## The ask

Quote the request verbatim — the ticket text, the message, the meeting note — with its date and
source. Then say which parts of it this spec answers and which it does not. Quoting it exactly is
what makes later scope drift visible.

> "…the requester's exact words…" — source, date

- **Answers:** …
- **Does not answer:** … (and where that goes instead)

## The problem, measured

The evidence that this matters: an incident, a metric, a log query, ticket history. Take every
number from **one snapshot** and give its timestamp and source. If a number moved while you were
measuring, say it moved; don't average it away. If the problem can't be measured yet, say so —
and let Phase 0 be what measures it.

| Measure | Value | Source (query, dashboard, file) | Taken at |
|---|---|---|---|
| … | … | … | … |

## What is true today

Every claim about the current code, pinned to where it lives. A claim without a `Where` is a
memory, not a fact. For a negative claim ("nothing else calls this"), record the search that
proved it.

| # | Fact | Where (`file:line` @ commit) | How verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | … | `path/to/file.ext:42` @ `abc1234` | read the function |
| F2 | Nothing outside `module/` calls `thing()` | — | `git grep -n "thing("` → 3 hits, all in `module/` |

**What this research did not cover:** name the files, services, environments or data you did
*not* read, so nobody mistakes a partial look for a complete one.

## Assumptions checked

Where reading the code changed the premise of the ask. Number each one and point at the section it
changed. If the reading confirmed everything, write "None found" — an empty section is a result.

1. The ask assumed … ; the code shows … (F2). This changes **Design**.

## Design

### Approach

What will be built, in prose a reviewer can argue with. Cite facts by number (F1, F2).

### Options considered

| Option | What it means | What it costs | |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — … | … | … | **Recommended** — why |
| B — … | … | … | |

### What it costs

Runtime, build time, money, complexity, on-call load. Say which figures are measured and which are
estimated.

### What it does not stop

The residual risk after this ships, stated rather than implied.

## Phases

Smallest useful step first. **Phase 0 changes no behaviour**: it records, measures, logs or
reports, so it is safe to ship alone, and its data sizes the phases after it. Each phase merges
green on its own.

| Phase | What | Behaviour change | Gated on | Verified by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Instrument / report only | **None** | Sign-off of this spec | … |
| 1 | … | … | Phase 0 data (default window: one week) or a named decision | … |

When a phase ships, mark it built here and add an **As built** list: every deviation from this
spec, each with its reason.

## Test plan

What proves each phase works, including the refusals and failure paths — not just the happy path.

| Phase | Test | Level (unit / integration / e2e / manual) | Proves |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | … | unit | … |

**Mutation check:** for the key test, what change to the code makes it fail? If none does, the test
proves nothing.

## Rollout and rollback

Flags, migrations, ordering, who needs to know. For each phase: how to undo it and how long that
takes.

## Before and after

| Headline metric | Baseline (n, window) | Target | After (n, window) |
|---|---|---|---|
| … | … | … | filled in after the build |

"Not measurable at this sample size" is an honest result when the change is smaller than normal
day-to-day variation.

## Out of scope

What this deliberately does not build, each with the reason, so none of it is re-proposed later as
an oversight.

- **…** — because …

## Open questions

Numbered. Each gives the options, a **recommended** answer, and whose call it is. When answered,
edit it in place to `DECIDED (date, ADR link)` or `DEFERRED (to what)`. Never delete a question.

1. **…?** Options: A / B. **Recommended: A**, because … · Decides: …

## Decisions

The ADRs this spec created or depends on, by id.

## Docs updated in this change

The READMEs, guides, instruction files and comments that describe the code this changes, and
whether each was updated. "None describe it" is a valid answer if you checked.

## Self-check

Does the core recommendation reduce to "be more careful"? If yes, it is a wish, not a design:
replace it with something that runs, blocks or measures.
