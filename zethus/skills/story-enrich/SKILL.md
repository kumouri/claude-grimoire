name: story-enrich
description: Research one or more existing Jira stories against the real codebase, cited to file:line via research-existing-code, and produce an enriched version — what it actually touches, current behaviour, tightened or added acceptance criteria, risks and edge cases, and open questions for the PO — human-relevant only, no agent chatter, stack traces, or code dumps. Detects available Jira access (an Atlassian/Jira MCP tool, the jira/acli CLI, or REST via an env token) and degrades to pasted story text when none is available. Outputs a proposed update plus a diff against the original; nothing is written back to Jira without explicit human approval. Use when a story needs fleshing out before estimation or before work starts, or when asked to enrich, flesh out, or research a ticket.

# Story enrich

A Jira story is usually written before anyone reads the code it touches. This skill closes that
gap: it researches what's actually there, then hands back a version a person can act on — never a
transcript of how the research happened.

## Step 1: get the story

Try these in order, and use the first that works:

1. **An Atlassian/Jira MCP tool**, if this session has one — check your own available tools; this
   is a fact about the session, not something a script can detect. Use it read-only: fetch the
   story's title, description, acceptance criteria, and key.
2. **A CLI or REST access**, detected with `python .github/zethus/scripts/jira-access.py`. Exit `0`
   names a `jira`/`acli` CLI or a REST token; use it read-only, the same way.
3. **Pasted text.** If neither is available, ask the person to paste the story's title,
   description, acceptance criteria, and key (if it has one). This is a normal path, not a
   fallback to apologize for — plenty of repos have no Jira access wired up at all.

## Step 2: research

Hand the story's description and acceptance criteria to
[research-existing-code](../research-existing-code/SKILL.md) as the question: what does this
actually touch, and what does it do today? That skill's output — a facts table cited to
`file:line`, plus what it didn't cover — is the evidence base for the enrichment. Don't skip it and
write the enrichment from the story text alone; the story text is exactly the thing being checked.

## Step 3: produce the enrichment

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Summary | One or two sentences, plus the original key/link if there is one. |
| What it actually touches | Files, modules, or services, cited to `file:line`. |
| Current behaviour | What the code does today, as observed — not what the story assumed. |
| Acceptance criteria | The original criteria, each marked kept / tightened / added, plus any new ones the research surfaced. Given/When/Then or a checklist. |
| Risks & edge cases | What the research found that could go wrong, and any case the current acceptance criteria don't cover. |
| Open questions for the PO | Anything only a person can decide — scope, priority, a tradeoff the code doesn't resolve. |
| Evidence | A short, cited list — see below. |
| Links | The spec or ADR this traces to, if any, and related stories. |

### Human-relevant only

The output is read by a person deciding whether to start this work, not by another agent
continuing it. Leave out:

- Internal deliberation, tool-call narration, or anything describing *how the search went* rather
  than *what it found*.
- Stack traces and raw error output — describe the failure mode in a sentence instead.
- Code dumps. A citation (`file:line`) is enough; an inline snippet is fine only when it's a handful
  of lines that the sentence around it can't say more plainly, and even then it's still cited.

The **Evidence** section is where citations live: a short list, each line one fact and its
`file:line`, in the same style [research-existing-code](../research-existing-code/SKILL.md) uses.
It is not a place to paste the research transcript.

## Step 4: diff against the original

Produce the enrichment as a proposed update, then a diff against the original story text (a unified
diff is fine) so the reviewer sees exactly what changed rather than re-reading the whole thing.
[`example/`](example/) has a worked pair: [`example/story-before.md`](example/story-before.md),
[`example/story-enriched.md`](example/story-enriched.md), and the diff between them.

## Guardrail: drafts only

This skill never updates, comments on, or edits a field on a real Jira issue. It produces the
proposed update and the diff, and stops.

**Only an explicit "update it" / "post this" / "approved", said after being shown the diff, counts
as approval.** Silence or a question doesn't. Once approved, write back using whichever access was
detected in Step 1 — MCP, CLI, or REST — one issue at a time, and report what was written (which
fields or comment, on which key). If access is pasted-input only, hand the person the proposed
update to paste in themselves; that's not a lesser outcome, it's the guardrail working as intended.

## Anti-patterns

- **Skipping Step 2** and rewriting the story from its own text — that just launders the story's
  existing assumptions with more words.
- **A citation that doesn't support the claim next to it.** Same rule as
  [research-existing-code](../research-existing-code/SKILL.md).
- **Pasting a stack trace or a 40-line function** into the output because it was handy. Cite it.
- **Writing back to Jira before an explicit approval of the diff shown.**

## Next

If the story traces back to a spec, [spec-to-stories](../spec-to-stories/SKILL.md) may already
have produced the traceability link this skill's *Links* section can point to.
