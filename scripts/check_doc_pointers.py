"""CI check: every pointer in this repo's Markdown must still resolve.

Docs drift in many ways, and only one of them is mechanical: a doc that names a file which was
renamed or deleted. This check catches exactly that class, and it can never "fix" anything by
appending. It is the mechanical half of the "detail in the leaf, routers stay routers" rule in
``AGENTS.md``; the other half (keeping behaviour descriptions true) is the job of whoever changes
the behaviour, in the same change.

What counts as a pointer
========================
1. **Links.** ``[text](target)``, ``![alt](target)`` and ``[ref]: target`` definitions. A target
   that is not a URL (no ``scheme:``), not a bare ``#anchor`` and not a template placeholder must
   name a tracked file or directory, *with that exact case*, inside the repository. It is
   resolved from the linking file's directory, or from the repo root if it starts with ``/``. The
   ``#anchor`` part is not checked.
2. **Backticked repo paths.** An inline code span shaped like a path to a file
   (``dir/name.ext``, optionally ``:line`` or ``:start-end``) or a directory (``dir/sub/``). It
   must resolve against the file's directory, any ancestor directory up to the repo root, or as the
   tail of a tracked path (so ``src/mnemosyne/stores.py`` in the root doc finds
   ``mnemosyne/src/mnemosyne/stores.py``). A path the repo's ``.gitignore`` rules cover also
   resolves: it names a runtime or generated file (``memory/local.jsonl``), which is never tracked.

Fenced code blocks are never checked: they hold commands and examples, not pointers.

What is deliberately not a pointer
==================================
Precision matters more than recall here. A check that cries wolf gets switched off, and a naive
version of this lint elsewhere reported 77 findings of which 2 were real. So a code span is skipped
when it is:

* an install destination on a user's machine or in a consuming repo: its first segment is one of
  ``HOST_DIRS`` (``.claude/``, ``.copilot/``, ...), or it starts with ``~``;
* in a file listed in ``EXAMPLE_DOCS``: skill bodies, templates and worked examples that are run or
  installed *inside another project*, so every path in them is that project's;
* a path in *the consuming project* that a kit's README or design doc describes: see
  ``CONSUMER_PATHS``, which is scoped per kit directory;
* anything with a placeholder or glob character (``<``, ``{``, ``*``, ``$``, ``%``), a domain
  (``github.com/...``), or no file extension and no trailing slash (``origin/develop`` is a git
  ref, not a path).

A **point-in-time** document (an assessment or a retrospective) cites code as it stood when it was
written, and removing that code must not break it. Such a file opts out of the code-span check
(its links are still checked) with this line anywhere in it::

    <!-- doc-pointers: point-in-time -->

Usage
=====
::

    python scripts/check_doc_pointers.py            # every tracked (and new, unignored) *.md
    python scripts/check_doc_pointers.py a.md docs  # only these files / directories

Exits 0 when every pointer resolves, 1 with ``path:line: <pointer> (<reason>)`` per broken one,
2 on a usage error. Stdlib only.
