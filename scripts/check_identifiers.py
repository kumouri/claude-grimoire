"""CI guard: no machine-specific identifier may be committed to this public repo.

**This repository is public. Every byte committed here is published.** This
check is the cheap, always-on tripwire for the class of leak that is easiest to
commit by accident: an absolute path from the machine the work was done on.

Guiding rule: **scrub the machine, keep the author.**

The guard works by SHAPE, not by a list of secret strings
=========================================================
Every rule below describes the *form* of a machine identifier. The forms are
public knowledge -- everyone knows Windows home directories look like
``<drive>:\\Users\\<name>``. What is private is the *name that appears in that
slot*, and this file never needs to know it in order to reject it.

That is deliberate and it is the whole design. A guard built the obvious way --
a denylist of the private terms to forbid -- would have to *contain* those terms,
and committing it here would publish the very thing it was written to protect.
If you are ever about to add a term to this file, apply this test: **would you
be comfortable seeing that term on the repo's GitHub page?** If not, it does not
belong here; express it as a shape instead, or leave it to the private sweep
described under "What this guard cannot see".

What this guard CANNOT see  (read this before trusting it)
==========================================================
This check has **no knowledge of the private denylist** -- the real names of
clients, businesses, projects and workspace trees that must never be published.
Those live only in a private scrub workspace outside this repository, and they
are deliberately not reproduced here.

Therefore:

*   A green run here means "no identifier of a *known shape* was found."
    It does **not** mean "this repo is free of private information."
*   The pre-release gate remains the private sweep::

        pii_sweep.py --repo <path-to-this-repo> --history --denylist <private denylist>

    That tool matches literal private terms, and it scans **git history** as
    well as the working tree. This check scans **only the current working tree**
    via ``git ls-files`` -- it will never notice something already committed and
    later deleted.
*   This check is a cheap always-on **subset** of that sweep, not a replacement
    for it. Do not read a green tick here as clearance to publish.

What this guard deliberately does NOT flag
==========================================
Ceryce's name, her ``@kumouri`` handle, and the portfolio attribution lines in
``README.md`` and ``CLAUDE.md`` are **deliberate attribution** -- this is her
signed portfolio repo and the signature is the point. No rule targets them, by
design: a rule against the author's own name in her own portfolio would be
nothing but false positives, and "fixing" it would be the wrong repair. Her
contact address is likewise sanctioned, via ``ALLOWED_EMAILS`` below, so that
the email rule still catches any *other* address that appears.

Usage
=====
Scan the whole tracked tree from the repo root (what CI runs)::

    python scripts/check_identifiers.py

Scan specific files instead -- useful for confirming the rules actually fire::

    python scripts/check_identifiers.py /tmp/scratch.md

Exits 0 and prints a one-line clean summary when nothing matched; exits 1 and
prints ``path:line: <what matched>`` plus a one-line reason for every hit.
