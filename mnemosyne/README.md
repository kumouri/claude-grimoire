# Mnemosyne

**A generic, git-backed reflexion memory for agent pipelines.** An agent (or a team) captures
durable *lessons* from its work, recalls the relevant ones into future work, and governs
promotion of local lessons to a shared, PR-reviewed store. It implements the Reflexion loop
([Shinn et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)) with a domain-agnostic, config-driven
recall engine and five hygiene mechanisms that keep signal above noise.

> Named for Mnemosyne, the Greek titaness of memory.

The engine is **stdlib-only Python** (no runtime dependencies) and uses **git as both the store
and the distribution channel**. It ships in three forms — a **CLI/library**, a **Claude Code
plugin**, and an **MCP server** — all over the same engine.

## The loop

```
        recall relevant lessons                 reflect feedback into a lesson
   (before you plan/implement) ──▶ apply ──▶ do the work ──▶ (a real, reusable miss)
              ▲                                                        │
              └──────────────── promote (local ▶ shared, human-reviewed) ◀┘
```

- **Recall** durable lessons for the task and **apply** them.
- **Announce** which lessons you applied (transparency — never silent memory).
- **Reflect / capture** when a real, reusable lesson emerges.
- **Promote** a good local lesson so the team gets it (a human reviews the PR).

## Install

Pick whichever surface fits — they all drive the same git-backed store.

**1. CLI / Python library** (the foundation)

```bash
pip install mnemosyne-reflexion          # or: pip install "mnemosyne-reflexion[mcp]" for the MCP server
mnemosyne --repo ./my-memory init --example software-eng
```

```python
import mnemosyne as mn
mn.recall("migrating the ledger POST endpoint", stage="plan")
```

**2. Claude Code plugin** — a skill + hooks (auto-recall on each prompt, sync on session start) +
`/recall`, `/reflect`, `/promote` commands. Install the `mnemosyne` plugin from this repo, then set
`MNEMOSYNE_REPO` to your memory repo. (The plugin's hooks call the `mnemosyne` CLI, so
`pip install mnemosyne-reflexion` first.)

**3. MCP server** — the same operations as MCP tools for any MCP client:

```bash
claude mcp add mnemosyne -e MNEMOSYNE_REPO=/path/to/memory-repo -- python -m mnemosyne.mcp_server
```

## Quickstart (CLI)

```bash
export MNEMOSYNE_REPO=./my-memory
mnemosyne init --example software-eng           # scaffold memory/ + a config

# recall before starting work
mnemosyne recall --query "adding a new POST that mutates customer PII" --stage implement

# reflect a real failure into a lesson (lands in your local tier)
mnemosyne reflect \
  --title "Pin idempotency for every new POST endpoint" \
  --lesson "Decide the idempotency contract up front and add it as an acceptance criterion." \
  --reflection-of "A new POST double-posted on replay because idempotency was never specified." \
  --tags idempotency,replay --stage plan --confidence high

# share it with the team (moves local ▶ shared, stages a review PR)
mnemosyne promote L-0006
```

## Configuration

A `mnemosyne.config.json` (resolved from `--config`, `$MNEMOSYNE_CONFIG`,
`<repo>/mnemosyne.config.json`, or the bundled default) makes the engine domain-agnostic. It
defines the lifecycle **stages**, the recall **axes** (each with a `weight` and a `match` strategy:
`set`, `glob`, or `glob_scalar`), a controlled **vocab** + **stopwords** for extracting context
from a brief, and the enums/thresholds. Adding an axis to the config automatically adds its CLI
flag and makes it scored — **no code change**.

The fastest way to author one is the **wizard** — an interactive, self-documenting builder that
explains every setting as it asks, seeds from a preset, validates the result, and writes a config
carrying an `_about` block that documents each field (the engine ignores it):

```bash
mnemosyne wizard                       # writes <repo>/mnemosyne.config.json
mnemosyne wizard --output ./my.config.json
```

Three examples ship: `default` (minimal — tags + stages + free-text), `software-eng` (tags,
components, work-types, source-systems, services, endpoint-patterns), and `multi-store` (default
axes plus a `stores` block wiring in `team`/`enterprise` tiers — see below). Inspect the active
config with `mnemosyne config`.

A config may also declare **stores** — additional shared memory repos federated in as broader
tiers. Each store has a `tier` label, a distinct id `prefix` (so federated ids never collide), and
a git `url` (auto-cloned) or a `path` to an existing repo:

```json
"stores": [
  {"tier": "team",       "prefix": "T", "url": "git@github.com:org/team-memory.git"},
  {"tier": "enterprise", "prefix": "E", "url": "git@github.com:org/enterprise-memory.git"}
]
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `recall` | Context in → ranked, budgeted lesson digest out (the hot path). |
| `capture` / `add` | Save a decision/convention/… to the local tier. |
| `reflect` | Save a learned-from-failure lesson (needs `--reflection-of`). |
| `promote <id…>` | Promote local lesson(s) to shared, or `--to <tier>` / `--from-file <manifest>` to export up to a store. |
| `sync` | `git pull` the shared memory + every configured store; retire exported-then-approved originals. |
| `stores` | List configured shared stores (broader tiers) + their clone/pull status. |
| `render` | Regenerate `memory/LESSONS.md` from the JSONL. |
| `list` / `show` / `stats` | Browse and summarize lessons (`list --tier`/`--store`; `stats` shows counts by tier). |
| `validate` | Schema + spine consistency (exit 0 ok / 1 problems). |
| `prune` | Retire (never delete) aged / over-cap low-value lessons (dry-run unless `--apply`). |
| `hygiene` | Health report: duplicates, never-recalled, cap headroom, prune candidates. |
| `init` | Scaffold a memory repo (`--example <name>` seeds a config, e.g. `multi-store`). |
| `wizard` | Interactively build a documented `mnemosyne.config.json` (self-documenting prompts + `_about` block). |
| `config` | Print the resolved active config and its source. |
| `selftest` | Zero-dependency test suite. |

Everything is also available as the Python API (`mn.recall/capture/reflect/promote/export/prune/…`)
and as MCP tools.

Environment: `MNEMOSYNE_REPO` (primary repo), `MNEMOSYNE_CONFIG` (config path), `MNEMOSYNE_AUTHOR`
(lesson author), and `MNEMOSYNE_CACHE` (where url-stores are cloned; default `~/.mnemosyne/stores`).

```

`memory/local.jsonl` and `memory/usage.local.json` are per-developer and gitignored; only
`memory/lessons.jsonl` (+ the generated `LESSONS.md`) is committed and shared.

## Tiers & transparency

- **local** (`memory/local.jsonl`, gitignored) — instant, per-developer capture.
- **shared** (`memory/lessons.jsonl`, committed) — team-wide truth; entered only via a reviewed
  promotion PR (see [`docs/lesson-review-checklist.md`](docs/lesson-review-checklist.md)).
- **stores** (`config.stores`) — broader shared repos (e.g. `team`, `enterprise`) federated in at
  recall time and written up to with `promote --to <tier>`. `recall` reads them best-effort (an
  unreachable store is skipped with a note, never a failure); `sync` pulls them and retires a local
  original once its exported copy is approved upstream. See [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md).

Every command prints a quotable `RECALL:` / `SAVED:` / `PROMOTED:` / `EXPORTED:` line meant to be
relayed verbatim. Memory is never applied silently and never shared unreviewed.

## Development

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m mnemosyne selftest     # zero-dep test suite
```

The engine has no runtime dependencies; only the MCP server needs the `mcp` package (installed via
the `[mcp]` extra).
