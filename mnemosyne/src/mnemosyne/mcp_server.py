"""Mnemosyne MCP server — exposes the reflexion memory as MCP tools.

Any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, ...) can recall/capture/reflect/promote
against a git-backed memory. Thin adapters over the public API in `mnemosyne`; the repo and
config resolve from $MNEMOSYNE_REPO / $MNEMOSYNE_CONFIG exactly like the CLI.

Run (not on PyPI yet, so install from GitHub with the [mcp] extra):
    pip install "mnemosyne-reflexion[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/kumouri/mesmer-grimoire#subdirectory=mnemosyne"
    MNEMOSYNE_REPO=/path/to/memory-repo python -m mnemosyne.mcp_server

Register (Claude Code):
    claude mcp add mnemosyne -e MNEMOSYNE_REPO=/path/to/memory-repo -- python -m mnemosyne.mcp_server
